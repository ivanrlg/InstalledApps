# Business Central Custom API: Listing Installed Apps On-Premises

This repository contains the code for a custom API in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This API is designed to list all installed applications in an On-Premises environment.

## Business Central Code

The code creates a custom API based on the "NAV App Installed App" table. This table contains information about all installed applications in Business Central. Here's the API code:
